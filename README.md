# bevy_sokoban

This is Sokoban implemented by following [@iolivia](https://github.com/iolivia)'s [Rust sokoban](https://sokoban.iolivia.me) tutorial — but in [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) instead of [ggez](https://ggez.rs/).

This is literally my first experience in gamedev, so the code is probably not very idiomatic and/or clean — all feedback is very much appreciated!

NB: At the moment of writing Bevy is still at the very early stages of development. Please consider [contributing](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/contributing/) or [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/cart) :)
